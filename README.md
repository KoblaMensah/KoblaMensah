# Hi, I'm Frederick Mensah

**Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Deep Learning & AI**

Welcome to my GitHub. I build end-to-end machine learning systems that solve real-world problems — from data pipelines and model training to explainability and deployment. My work focuses on the insurance and financial services domain, where I apply deep learning, statistical modeling, and responsible AI practices.
